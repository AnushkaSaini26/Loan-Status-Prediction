Loan Status Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the status of loan applications using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify loan applications into approved or rejected categories based on various features provided in the dataset.
Loan status prediction is a common problem in the finance industry, where financial institutions need to determine whether to approve or reject loan applications. This project uses a dataset containing information about applicants and their loan applications to train a machine learning model that can predict the status of new loan applications.
