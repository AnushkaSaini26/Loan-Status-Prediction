## Loan Status Prediction


This repository contains the code and resources for predicting the status of loan applications using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify loan applications into approved or rejected categories based on various features provided in the dataset.

Loan status prediction is a common problem in the finance industry, where financial institutions need to determine whether to approve or reject loan applications. This project uses a dataset containing information about applicants and their loan applications to train a machine learning model that can predict the status of new loan applications.

The dataset used in this project consists of various features such as applicant's income, credit history, loan amount, loan term, and more. Each record in the dataset represents a loan application, and the target variable indicates whether the loan was approved or rejected.
